# Static Site Builder

> **⚠️ Active Development**: This project is currently in active development.

A Ruby-based generator and builder for creating static HTML sites with working JavaScript. **No backend required** - just compile your ERB files to static HTML and deploy anywhere.

## Why This Exists

Generates standalone static sites from ERB templates, with a working dev server, file watching, and live reload. Generated projects are **self-contained**: the build code lives in the generated repo (`lib/site_builder.rb`).

## Why Choose This Over Other Approaches

**Better SEO & Search Rankings**: Unlike Single Page Applications (SPAs) that rely on client-side JS rendering, static HTML is immediately crawlable by search engines. Your content is fully indexed from the first request, leading to better search rankings and significantly faster page loads.

**Simplicity Over Complexity**: No need for complex JavaScript frameworks, hydration, or server-side rendering setups. Create .html.erb files that compile to clean, static HTML. Add JavaScript only where you need interactivity, not as a requirement for rendering.

**Developer Experience**: Work with familiar Rails patterns (layouts, pages, partials) without a full Rails application, allowing you to host it for free directly on Cloudflare CDNs and other static hosting services.

**Version Control & Mobile Editing**: Your entire site is code in a Git repository. Track changes, collaborate, and edit from anywhere - even your phone with tools like Cursor Agents. No database migrations or CMS interfaces needed. Lightning fast.

## Main Objective

Generate static HTML pages using ERB files. Simple and flexible - add your own JavaScript bundling and CSS processing as needed.

## Installation

```bash
gem install static-site-builder
# or
git clone https://github.com/Ancez/static-site-builder
cd static-site-builder
bundle install
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Install as a gem
```bash
gem install static-site-builder
static-site-builder new my-site
```

### Option 2: Use directly from repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ancez/static-site-builder
cd static-site-builder
bundle install
ruby bin/generate my-site
```

Generated sites use:
- ERB templates for HTML generation
- local build code in `lib/site_builder.rb` (no runtime dependency on this gem)

## What Gets Generated

A clean project structure that depends on gems:

```
my-site/
├── Gemfile              # Dependencies (rake, webrick, sitemap_generator, etc.)
├── Rakefile            # Build tasks (assets, HTML, CSS, sitemap, dev server)
├── config/
│   └── sitemap.rb      # Sitemap generation config
├── app/
│   ├── views/
│   │   ├── layouts/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   ├── javascript/
│   └── assets/
│       └── stylesheets/
└── lib/
    └── site_builder.rb   # Compiles your site
```

## How It Works

1. **Generator** (`static-site-builder new ...`) - Creates the project structure
2. **Generated build code** (`lib/site_builder.rb`) - Compiles pages/layouts and provides WebSocket live reload
3. **Build tools** (`Rakefile`) - Defines `build:*` tasks and `dev:server`
4. **Your tools** - Add Tailwind, bundlers, etc, and wire them via `package.json` scripts

## Features

- 🎯 **Static HTML output** - No server-side rendering needed
- 🔧 **Simple & flexible** - ERB files, add your own tools
- 📦 **Self-contained generated sites** - No runtime dependency on this gem
- 🚀 **Fast builds** - Compile once, deploy everywhere
- 🔄 **Live reload** - Rebuild and refresh on changes in development

## Templates

Generated sites use **ActionView** for Rails-like templates, helpers, layouts, and partials.

Create a layout in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/stylesheets/application.css">
</head>
<body>
  <main>
    <%= yield %>
  </main>

  <% if content_for?(:javascript) %>
    <%= yield(:javascript) %>
  <% end %>
</body>
</html>
```

`yield` outputs the page content. Use `content_for(:javascript)` to push scripts into the layout.

### Partials

Partials work like Rails, including `locals:`:

```erb
<%= render partial: 'shared/header', locals: { title: 'Home' } %>
```

### Adding JavaScript

Include JavaScript files in your pages:

```erb
<% content_for(:javascript) do %>
  <script src="/assets/javascripts/application.js"></script>
<% end %>
```

If you add a `package.json` with a `scripts.build`, `rake build:assets` will run `npm run build`. If you do not, it copies `app/javascript/` into `dist/assets/javascripts/`.

Set up your own bundler if needed and output to `dist/assets/javascripts/`. See setup guides:
- [ESBuild](guides/setup-esbuild.md)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - see webpack documentation
- [Vite](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite_ruby) - see vite-plugin-ruby

### Adding CSS

Write CSS in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`. Use any CSS tool you prefer:

- [Tailwind CSS](guides/setup-tailwind.md)
- PostCSS, Sass, Less, or any other CSS processor - just compile your CSS files to `dist/assets/stylesheets/` before building HTML.

### Generating Sitemaps

Sitemap generation is automatically configured when you generate a new site. The `sitemap_generator` gem is included in the Gemfile, and `config/sitemap.rb` is automatically created.

The sitemap is automatically generated from all pages in `app/views/pages/` during `rake build:all`. Update `config/sitemap.rb` to set your domain:

```ruby
SitemapGenerator::Sitemap.default_host = 'https://yourdomain.com'
```

You can customize priority, changefreq, and lastmod in `config/sitemap.rb`. The sitemap will be generated in `dist/sitemaps/sitemap.xml.gz` during the build process.

## Examples

### Basic ERB Site
```bash
static-site-builder new my-site
```

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.0+
- Bundler

Optional (if you want to use Tailwind CSS or JavaScript bundlers):
- Node.js and npm

## Development

### Running Your Site Locally

After generating a site, you can run it locally with auto-rebuild and live reload:

```bash
cd my-site
bundle install

# Start development server (auto-rebuilds on file changes)
rake dev:server
```

This will:
- Build your site to `dist/`
- Start a web server at `http://localhost:3000`
- Watch for file changes and rebuild automatically
- Auto-refresh your browser when files change

You can change the port with:
```bash
PORT=8080 rake dev:server
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build everything (assets + HTML)
rake build:all

# Or just HTML
rake build:html

# Output is in dist/ directory
```

## Deployment

The `dist/` directory contains your complete static site and can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

See deployment guides for specific platforms:
- [Cloudflare Pages](guides/deployment-cloudflare.md)
- [Vercel](guides/deployment-vercel.md)
- [Netlify](guides/deployment-netlify.md)
- [GitHub Pages](guides/deployment-github-pages.md)
- [Other Static Hosts](guides/deployment-other.md)

### Generator Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Ancez/static-site-builder
cd static-site-builder

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run tests
bundle exec rspec

# Build the gem
gem build static-site-builder.gemspec
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

- Unit tests for Generator and Builder classes
- Integration tests for full build workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Tests for all stack combinations

Run tests with:
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

View coverage report:
```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

## Architecture

This generator follows the Rails pattern:
- **Generator gem** - Creates project structure
- **Builder gem** - Handles compilation (separate gem: `static-site-builder`)
- **Standard gems** - Reuse existing Ruby gems
- **Generated code** - Minimal, uses gem dependencies
